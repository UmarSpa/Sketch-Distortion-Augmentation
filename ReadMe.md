**transXVar:** Translation along x axis  
**transYVar:** Translation along y axis  
**rotateVar:** Degrees of rotation  
**scaleXVar:** Scale along x axis  
**scaleYVar:** Scale along y axis  
**skewXVar:** Skew along x axis  
**skewYVar:** Skew along y axis  
**pathXVar:** Path jittering along x axis  
**pathYVar:** Path jittering along y axis  
**curveXVar:** Bézier Curve jittering along x axis  
**curveYVar:** Bézier Curve jittering along y axis
